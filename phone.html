            Expensive smartphones are often more interesting from a feature and specification viewpoint, but the real volumes flow in the budget segment.<br>
            With mobile data becoming more affordable, many more Indians can now afford to get onto the smartphone bandwagon. These days, even affordable <br>
            smartphones come with all of the features you’d expect to see on more expensive devices, including high-resolution screens, good cameras, fingerprint<br>
            sensors and 4G connectivity. We’ve put together a list of some of the best affordable smartphones - priced at under Rs. 10,000 - that you can buy today.

        In the world of smartphones, we’ve reached a point where it’s no longer necessary to spend absurd amounts of money to get some pretty cool features in phones.<br>
        Even in the mainstream segment, one can find some good deals if you know where to look.If you have a budget of around Rs. 20,000, then you can find a pretty diverse<br>
        set of good smartphones on offer. It was just last year that the in-display fingerprint sensor became all the rage in flagship phones, and today, you can actually get<br>
        that in a phone under Rs. 20,000. Not only that, but due to stiff competition and recent price cuts, you can actually get a phone with a flagship-level Qualcomm SoC<br>
        from 2018 in this price range too.

      The prices of flagship-class smartphones have skyrocketed over the past few years, and it isn’t shocking at all to see people spend more than Rs. 70,000 for the latest iPhone,<br>
      Samsung Galaxy, and Google Pixel models. Thankfully, if your budget isn’t quite so generous, you can get very nearly the same performance, features, and style for less than half<br>
      as much. The sub-Rs. 30,000 category has plenty of options, and some of the recently launched models at this price level even boast of features that much more expensive<br>
      flagships don’t have yet.If you can spend up to Rs. 30,000, you can get yourself a phone that does it all. You don’t have to compromise on camera quality, battery life, or<br>
      modern conveniences. Some of our picks for the best smartphones priced below Rs. 30,000 might surprise you with their features, such as the Vivo V15 Pro’s pop-up selfie camera<br>
      and in-display fingerprint sensor, or the Samsung Galaxy A9 (2018)’s four rear cameras.

    The best camera phones are getting to the point that you can often get more consistent results with what's in your pocket than what's in your camera bag! The old saying goes that<br>
    the best camera is the one that you have with you, but now it's more than just convenience – these shooter-friendly smartphones mean that you have an incredibly powerful imaging<br>
    tool with you everywhere you go. Indeed, the best camera phones pack more pixels than most medium format cameras, and are also capable of 8K video that traditional cameras<br>
    haven't yet caught up with. Take the Samsung Galaxy S20 Ultra, for instance, with its 108MP image sensor, 8K video at up to 30fps, and astonishing 100x digital zoom.
