        <center><p class="P3">

          If not for this biological activity there wouldn't have been oh boi I miss this.. Creating memories is worth a king's ransom. They last a lifetime giving us a sense of beattitude. Things stay for a short-period of time, it is like the treasure that we keep locked deep within the storehouse of the breath of life, to keep our hearts warm when we are lonely. The quadrant progressive matches of Kazhida at Swarnathu cause of Oppol's masterful bad shuffling, the ultimate cricket matches in Thalam where not breaking the tubes is the ultimate achivement.. and the long walks in Paadam are some memories that never die. Looking back through the years we said a lot of goodbyes but the moments that we spent with 'em explains that our hearts did not hear those goodbyes and carries the embodiments with it thinking that they are the ones worth a lifetime and that's when you realise who they are. If we think about it memories are the only paradise from which we can never be expelled and down this Paradise each of them lead us to the present moment and shows us how many dreams have we lost in the way. We just regret of all the things that passes by and time which flies by and I wish I wasn't worried of the people around and felt comfortable about the things but I got chance, the world is open and the star above.. The moments frozen on the grass and I'll be dreaming about the good old days I wish somebody had told me that that those good old days, the twilights, the stories, the songs that those are the days we won't forget and when the whole life changes we will miss the rune of those good old days. But if you want to do this all over again thinking about the past then don't miss out on now cause now is much more beautiful also we have seen things, we have felt things and I have been around the past but. . . . But I'm here *Now* making those good old days</b>

          Since the day I remember of my Illam. I had this mental picture painted of these huge fronds of banana tress showering over the small plants of ghost peppers and the Brobdingnagian type of coconut trees which never ceases stop to grow. Then you have the sappy rubber tree existing in midst of all the glory of Teak woods. Then there is this small edifice where my family has been staying for the past half a century. Every summer I would walkthrough the heavenly backwoods experiencing the motherly feels with Bryan Adams belt out the summer of '69

.

Oh when I look back....

.

The summer seemed to last forever...

.

Those were the best days of my life...

.

And I would come back and jam with my cousin's with Barso re megha on playback and we going crazy over the fresh morru that Savitri kutti churns out of her pot. We go to sleep thinking all of the mangoes that we will steal from the Paadam... We get up take a splash in Kolam and then begins a round robin of channels watching all the cartoons ever featured.. Blisssssssss....

.

But now trying to comprehend that the home our own abode is gonna be turned to dust is just killing the nostalgia...

.

Man we were killin' time

.

We were young and restless

.

We needed to unwind

.

I guess nothin' can last forever, forever, no!!!

.

But things come and come go that's life and we move on and on on.....</p></center>

it was a night of that would be revered by me endlessly. The day I met the god himself HSRK. I was siting there all exhalated trying to deem myself that today i will meet him and I hoped to talk. I was sitting there laid repleted in total silence to be tapped by the voice of his.

He talked about how he had turned into a minstrel from a developer and then introduced us to players who backed him up with precussion, keys and tabla. He hummed a symphony and the patrons cheered in furor. The minstrel started with the Brindavana Saranga raaga then the pallavi

I remeiniscented to the times when I sang this song on playback in my dorm and now there I stood trying to resonate each note and he stood there pointing asking us to bell out the lyrics. The melliflous voice echoed through the theatre and people just sitting amazed and wondering if it was possible to see a god standing so humble and jamming with the ordinary. Then from a distant Sithara came running and asked for blessings and he stood there wondering how possibbly can he bless the other embodiment who rests in the hand of Saraswati. Then she broke the silence by singing about calamoitous floods that affected the onlookers and asked them to percuss with haa after each aallapa. The unheard tunes raged through the crowd , I could feel it in my bones I solaced on each beat it was night of thousand and one raagas and then he stopped with his last ballad ending the journey of the first meet. I stood up to in recognition of his magnanimity and rushed outside to frame that face with mine and heed my admiration for his piece and I walked out in bliss wondering if this was inception of the second. A zephyr took me by surprise and I saw a haze down the lane to understand it was the

          <u><h1>Mumbai Meri Jaan</h1></u>
        <center><p class="P32">

          Apparently it's been half a decade since we moved out from the city of dreams the one way nagari.. the bhulbhaliyya Mumbai hain one way nagari.
.
Mumbai stands out with long colonial past handed down from the Dutch Imperialists to British, the city has faced the wrath of the clock every now and then, but it goes on still standing out as a servant to a contrast of existence, the existence driven by the indomitable spirit of Mumbaikars. NO one needs a chill pill in the city cause all you need is  a stroll down the  Queen's necklace where you soak down the thousands of street lights lined up and as you move down the quaint lanes you get lost in pages of history enunciated by the spirits of beyond. Each day in the burghal a darker grey breaks through the lighter one.. The hollow hurried sound of feets on the polished floor and the clerk closing up in the store counting the loonies trying not to stay.. and then the driver checks the mirror oh.. 10 minutes late  and the crowded rider's restlessness enunciates through the cabs.. Same route everyday and turning down the lanes the local train ka commute of Mumbai  spears through the city all the way. Everyday you will wake up in the rusted frame. Walking down the boulevard of encrusted temples in the arms of this stranger the disciples would hand you the catalogs of the textures around.. The night will always be young tellin' you its alright you have nothing to worry nothing to lose and let all the passing glance pass by and listen to the music in the air nearby and walk to the khao gali to get entrapped in the void with all eggs in the one basket..
It's been long time since the Mumbaikar days and I sure have wondered why a part of me still remains in a place so full of beauty that somehow never changed.
 Time has has me beliveing there is nothing left to prove I feel the love within me and it cant be removed and all these memories will just dance away with me into the stars...
Ai dil hain Mushkhil jeena yahan
Zara Hat ke Zara bach ke
Yeh hain *BAMBAI* meri jaan
Missing the Mumbai's Jaan...
.
.
.
Every single day..
.
.
.
Every Single night</p></center>
