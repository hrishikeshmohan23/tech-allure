                    <br><br>
                    <p  class="TXT">
                        The retailer claims savings up to $1,500, so it shouldn’t come as a surprise that these price cuts are for some of the most expensive configurations with a lot of memory, storage, and<br>
                        processing power. The biggest price cut is on the 2019 15-inch MacBook Pro with a Touch Bar, which comes loaded with a 9th Gen Intel Core i9 processor (six-core, base clock of 2.6GHz,<br>
                        turbo clock at 4.5GHz), 32GB of RAM, AMD’s Radeon Pro Vega 20 graphics, 1TB of solid-state storage. It costs $2,650 for today only. This model originally sold for $4,150, so this is a tremendous discount.<br>
                        A similarly configured 16-inch model with an AMD Radeon Pro 5500M costs $3,099.For a little less money, Best Buy sells a model that has all of the specs above, but with lesser graphics performance.<br>
                        Instead of the Radeon Pro Vega 20 graphics chip, it has the Radeon Pro 560X. This model costs $2,550 today, and it’s a whopping $1,200 off of its usual price. Given the choice between this model and<br>
                        the laptop mentioned just above, I’d go with the laptop that houses the Radeon Pro Vega 20 graphics for just $50 more, though this one’s no slouch.

                    <br><br>
                    <p class="TXT">
                        Later this year Samsung will finally kill off its S Voice assistant, which never really caught up to Apple’s Siri. A note on Samsung’s support page says S Voice will no longer be available from June 1,<br>
                        as first reported by SamMobile.Samsung’s first attempt at a voice assistant, S Voice was introduced in 2012 in the Galaxy S III, but was buggy and slow. As 9to5 Google notes, S Voice could set reminders<br>
                        and make calls but wasn’t able to answer user questions in a conversational way, like Siri and Google Assistant are designed to do.Samsung essentially replaced S Voice with Bixby in phones starting with the Galaxy S8<br>
                        (although Bixby itself hasn’t exactly impressed reviewers from The Verge over its lifespan, either). A few of Samsung’s wearables still have S Voice; the Galaxy Watch and Galaxy Active have Bixby upgrades available<br>
                        and a similar upgrade will be provided to Gear S3 and Gear Sport after June 1, according to Samsung.

                    <br><br>
                    <p  class="TXT">
                        Research firm Canalys has released its quarterly estimates on global PC shipments for Q1, and despite a surge in demand, “severe delays in production and logistical issues,” meant an 8 percent drop in shipments year-over-year.<br>
                        Both the demand and the delays are related to the coronavirus pandemic; while many people are working remotely and students are engaged in distance learning because of stay-at-home directives, disruptions to the supply chain,<br>
                        especially in China, meant shipments of computers were delayed.In Q1 2020, vendors shipped 53.7 million units, Canalys found. The new data estimates Lenovo led the PC market, with 12.8 million units shipped in Q1, a 4.4 percent<br>
                        year-over-year decline. HP shipped 11.7 million units, or 13.8 percent fewer than Q1 a year ago, and Dell shipped 10.5 million units, a slight uptick of 1.1 percent from the same time last year. According to Canalys estimates,<br> 
                        Apple saw shipments decline 21 percent year-over-year to 3.2 million units

                    <p class="TXT">
                        Today is the 50th anniversary of the launch of the Apollo 13 mission that never made it to the moon, the one where Commander Jim Lovell uttered the phrase “Houston, we’ve had a problem.” NASA calls the mission a “successful failure,”<br>
                        because even though an explosion crippled the primary spacecraft two days in, Lovell and fellow crewmembers Fred Haise and Jack Swigert returned safely to Earth thanks to the determined work of the ground crew at Mission Control.<br>
                        NASA isn’t planning in-person activities to commemorate the event due to the COVID-19 pandemic, but has released a documentary with archival footage from the mission. Apollo 13: Home Safe includes interviews with Lovell<br>
                        (it opens with him saying “it was plagued by bad omens and bad luck from the very beginning...”) and conversations with Haise, NASA flight directors Gene Kranz and Glynn Lunney and engineer Hank Rotter. Swigert died in 1982.<br>
                        NASA has other social media activities planned as well.

                    <br><br>
                    <p  class="TXT">
                        Earlier today, Apple and Google announced a Bluetooth-based COVID-19 contact tracing platform that could alert people if they’ve been exposed to the novel coronavirus. Contact tracing is a huge component in ending mass<br>
                        pandemic “stay-at-home” orders, and while phone tracking can’t replace traditional methods like interviews, it can supplement them.Google and Apple are using Bluetooth LE signals for contact tracing. When two people are near each other,<br>
                        their phones can exchange an anonymous identification key, recording that they’ve had close contact. If one person is later diagnosed with COVID-19, they can share that information through an app. The system will notify<br>
                        other users they’ve been close to, so those people can self-quarantine if necessary. Ideally, this means you won’t have to reveal your name, location, or other personal data.Beyond those basics, though, there are a lot of<br>
                        questions about how people will actually use the system. Here’s what we know so far.

                        Microsoft’s Xbox Live service experienced issues affecting online multiplayer earlier today. “We’re aware that some users may have trouble joining parties or playing online multiplayer & our teams are investigating,”<br>
                        Microsoft said in a 2:38PM ET tweet about the issues. Down Detector indicated a spike in user-reported problems shortly before 2PM ET. Microsoft said the issues should be resolved in a 4:53PM ET tweet.It was the third time<br>
                        in less than a month that Xbox Live experienced notable problems. Xbox Live went down for more than two hours on March 15th and had a multihour outage on March 20th.More people than ever are relying on services like Xbox Live<br>
                        for entertainment and to stay in contact with friends and family while stuck at home due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and that increased network traffic is putting a strain on those services. In late March, Microsoft said it was<br>
                        making tweaks to Xbox Live in an effort to reduce some of that strain, including turning off the ability to upload custom gamerpics and working with publishers to deliver game updates during off-peak hours.
