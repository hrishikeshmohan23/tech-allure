                    <br><br>
                    <p  class="TXT">
                        hat’s the most obvious feeling you get when using the Galaxy S20 Ultra, which will be available in March starting at $1,399.99. If there ever was<br>
                        an embodiment of the chip on a tech company’s shoulder, this behemoth of a phone is it. After a couple of years of lagging behind the iPhone and Android<br>
                        competitors in a few key areas, the Ultra is Samsung’s answer. It’s a Statement Phone, aiming to be the most powerful and best phone ever — price and size be damned.<br>
                        There are many impressive things about the S20 Ultra: the screen, the battery, 5G networking, speed, and more. But the flagship feature is the all-new camera system,<br> 
                        which features ultra-high megapixel counts and telephoto zoom in an attempt to kick off the next stage of mobile photography.Samsung called this phone the S20 instead of<br>
                        the S11 to indicate that it is the first of a new generation, and that might be too revealing. As impressive as the overall phone is, the camera often acts like a first-gen<br>
                        tech product with first-gen tech problems.

                    <br><br>
                    <p class="TXT">
                        I wish I could tell you exactly where I think the Motorola Razr went wrong, but there are too many options to choose from. It’s the first of a new generation of folding devices that open<br>
                        vertically into a regular phone shape instead of horizontally into a mini-tablet like Samsung’s Galaxy Fold. That means Motorola had the benefit of learning from earlier missteps<br>
                        from the Fold and a very few other devices, but it still makes too many mistakes of its ownveryEvery smartphone is a bundle of trade-offs. Even if price is no object and you want<br>
                        to buy the biggest, best phone on the market, you’re still making the most obvious trade-off of all: spending a lot of money.That is the Razr’s first major trade-off. I’m harping on<br>
                        the $1,500 price, but not because it’s too high for any phone. Phones are our primary computers, and many people could reasonably justify that price or something even higher for the<br>
                        right phone. The problem with the Razr is that it delivers so few of the things you’d expect at that — or any — price.But you likely aren’t coming to the Razr<br> because you care a lot<br>
                         about traditional ways to judge phones. The camera may be mediocre and the battery life sub-par, but it flips, damnit, and it looks like those classic Razr phones, just a little bigger.

                    <br><br>
                    <p  class="TXT">
                        The Pixel 4 and Pixel 4 XL are the best argument that specs don’t tell you everything you need to know about a phone — because the experience of using a Pixel 4 is better than any other Android phone.<br>
                        There is a nuanced difference between saying “specs don’t tell you the whole story” and “specs don’t matter,” because they absolutely do — if only because the wrong ones can ruin the whole thing.<br>
                        There are a few places where Google could have done better, especially with battery life. But overall the Pixel 4 hits enough of the marks to pass, and it’s a few new features from Google that push the<br>
                        experience ahead of the pack.The Pixel 4 starts at $799 for the smaller 5.7-inch screen version with 64GB of storage. I suspect many users will pay the $100 for the XL version with the bigger screen,<br>
                        the $100 more for 128GB of storage, or both. I am sympathetic to arguments that the specs don’t quite justify those prices.

                    <br><br>
                    <p class="TXT">
                        These days, it’s not challenging to find a phone that’s powerful enough to run most games on the App Store or Google Play Store, nor is it too costly. It’s also easy to buy a DualShock 4<br>
                        or Xbox One gamepad, then pair it to your phone via Bluetooth so you can have a console-like controller experience without being glued to your couch.Both of those points make it very hard for<br>
                        me to convince anyone to buy the Asus ROG Phone II, an $899 gaming-focused phone that has its own ecosystem of pricey proprietary accessories. The accessories were made for the phone, and the phone<br>
                        was made for these accessories, for better and worse.It costs a lot of money to unlock the potential of this phone, but there are quite a few things that I like about the device on its own<br>
                        It has three USB-C ports: one on its bottom and two joined together along its side.
