    Mobiles Laptops Cameras and everything about the beauty of those semiconductors fascinates me to the skies.
    And being around so many of em is too much for me to not be overwhelmed and just wonder how the 7 billion transistors on a
    sqaure inch of material make the process simple and unique. I love to write blogs and have reviewed various products for
    for some of the main workers in the industry I used to have a blog in which I will write everything that sparked a little
    awe in my mind about tech.. It makes me wonder how the industry has come so far just nudge with it.. if the automobile industry
    had grew in the scale of the semiconductor industry then it would have been cheaper to buy a Rolls Royce than parking it!!!

<p class="P3"><b>iPhone 11 series review</b></p>
<p>
<img src="7.jpg"><br>
The iPhone 11 Pro and iPhone 11 Pro Max did not arrive at the splashiest Apple event ever. Like their sibling the iPhone 11, 
hey were mostly seen as iterative updates to Apple’s existing iPhone XS and XS Max: relatively sedate changes to already winning 
devices. They now have three cameras, with an ultra-wide lens joining the standard wide angle and telephoto lenses on the rear. 
The displays are brighter. There’s a new processor and a new version of iOS, both in their 13th iterations. And they come in a matte finish on the back, 
with a new midnight green option. It’s not exactly an earth-shattering list of updates. But after using an iPhone 11 Pro and iPhone 11 
Pro Max for the past week, I think they’re more than the sum of several lightly updated parts. These are some of the most well-balanced, 
most capable phones Apple — or anyone — has ever made. They have excellent battery life, processors that should keep them relevant 
for years to come, absolutely beautiful displays, and a new camera system that generally outperforms every other phone, which should 
get even better with a promised software update later this fall.</p>

<p class="P3"><b>OnePlus 8 Pro Review</b></p>

<p>
<img src="8.jpg"><br>
OnePlus 8 Pro is the result of a relentless spec battle with Samsung. It’s an Android phone that spares almost no expense in the quest to 
include the most powerful, best hardware components. The result is the fastest Android phone experience money can buy — starting at $899. 
That price is simultaneously high and low. Nine hundred bucks is a lot for a OnePlus phone, but it’s still less expensive than its direct 
competition. For years, OnePlus succeeded with a two-pronged strategy of appealing to Android enthusiasts while undercutting the competition on price. 
But over the past few years, OnePlus has grown from a niche company for its fans to one of the most competitive players in the smartphone space. 
At the same time, its prices have steadily climbed as it got more serious about taking Samsung head-on. And there’s no denying that a $900 phone is expensive, 
no matter which company makes it.Samsung’s Galaxy line is the gold standard — not necessarily because it’s the best Android phone 
(last year, we gave that honor to the OnePlus 7T), but because it’s the most ubiquitous and trustworthy. The Galaxy is the default because 
it doesn’t lack any major feature, is reliably good, and is sold by every major carrier.</p>

<p class="P3"><b>Pixel 4 Series Review</b></p>
<img src="9.jpg">
<p>
  Pixel 4 and Pixel 4 XL are the best argument that specs don’t tell you everything you need to know about a phone — because the experience 
  of using a Pixel 4 is better than any other Android phone.There is a nuanced difference between saying “specs don’t tell you 
  the whole story” and “specs don’t matter,” because they absolutely do — if only because the wrong ones can ruin the whole thing. 
  There are a few places where Google could have done better, especially with battery life. But overall the Pixel 4 hits enough of
  the marks to pass, and it’s a few new features from Google that push the experience ahead of the pack.
  The Pixel 4 starts at $799 for the smaller 5.7-inch screen version with 64GB of storage. 
  I suspect many users will pay the $100 for the XL version with the bigger screen, the $100 more for 128GB of storage, or both. 
  I am sympathetic to arguments that the specs don’t quite justify those prices, but only to a point. With the Pixel 4, the cost isn’t 
  about the hardware — it’s about Google’s software, camera, and those new features.
  Most new phones try to layer on one or two new features year over year. But the Pixel 4 has at least five major new hardware-based 
  features: face unlock, Motion Sense, the new Google Assistant, the new 90Hz display, and a second telephoto camera lens. It’s also available 
  on all four major US carriers for the first time.
